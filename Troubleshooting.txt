1. Importing Excel :
   If you are having importing excel problems, add a new asset through
   software only and export it, now check if your data exported is in
   the format that the importing excel is in.
2. Do not ever cut and paste any file inside the software folder
   somewhere else as all the the files and folders are connected through
   each other in the same format as they are in the software folder.
3. If software is not working :
   Make sure that the software folder(AMS) is placed in "c://xampp/htdocs".
4. If Chart function is not opening :
   Make sure you are connected to internet as the chart is shown through
   google charts api.
